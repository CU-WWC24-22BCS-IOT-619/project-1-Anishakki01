Crop-Disease-Detection

Project Title

In Agriculture, leaf diseases have grown to be a dilemma as it can cause a significant diminution in both the quality and quantity of agricultural yields. Thus, automated recognition of diseases on leaves plays a crucial role in the agriculture sector. This Crop Disease detection project is based on the same idea which can be used to detect disease in specific crops on which it is trained

Problem Statement

In Agriculture sector plants or crops, cultivation has seen fast development in both the quality and quantity of food production. However, the presence of diseases on crops especially on leaves has hindered the quality of agricultural goods. This severe effect can disturb any nation's economy especially of those where 70% of the inhabitants rely on the products from the agricultural sector for their livelihood and endurance. This problem can be solved by the detection of crop diseases and to detect crop disease this project can be used. This project will diagnose the disease based on images of leaves.

Project Description

This project is created with the goal of detecting the disease of crop through its leaf. In this project concept of deep learning is used which uses the concept of neural networks to solve the critical tasks like human brain. For image classification task since we are classifying leaf image based on its disease so to serve that purpose we have used CNN (Convolution Neural Network) Famous for working with image data since it can detect features automatically in a fast way way because even normal images consists of lakhs of features

Advantages of this Project

Easily detect crop diseases to simplify treatment process.
One touch process to analyze crop defects.
The model will also help in improving harvest quality and accuracy, which is known as precision agriculture.

Conclusions

This project can be used for simplifying the process of crop disease detection. This project follows one touch process for detection of disease in crop if present. By detecting disease one can take steps for treatment of the same. This project will be beneficial on the specific crop category on which it is trained. This project can save a lot of time which is wasted on detection of diseases found in crop that too with good accuracy.
